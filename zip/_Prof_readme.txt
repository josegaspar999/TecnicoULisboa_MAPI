Note that groups of students start each Matlab session by running "login_mapi", which implies:
- The students get a working folder in c:\users2\...
- This SVN folder usually is not touched by students

Details:
- This folder contains zip files to be expanded for each group of students.
- As the zip files are kept untouched, they can be used for multiple groups of students.
- The files expanded from zips (i.e. not the original zip files) can be modified by each group of students without compromising the work of other groups.
- Folder ../tmp/. and its sub-folders contain functions ready to use, no need to install, but are also not to be modified by students.
