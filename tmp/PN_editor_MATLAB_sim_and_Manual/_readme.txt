
Creating and Analyzing Petri nets

April 2019, J. Gaspar
---------------------------------

Subfolder "tpn5" contains a Matlab toolbox, made by Zdenek Hanzalek and Martina Svadova, to open files with Petri nets and do some analysis on them. See help on using tpn5 in "./matlab_ps_tooldem.pdf".

Subfolder "pmedit", made by Alain Godon & Frédéric Bousseau, contains a GUI to create Petri nets. It is a 16 bits application so it does not run on 64bits systems. The Petri net example files (*.rdp) can still be used by the "tpn5" toolbox. Creating Petri nets on 64bit systems imply using other tools as PIPE2, for which the "tpn5" here included is already prepared. Please note that older versions of "tpn5" do not read PIPE2 files.
